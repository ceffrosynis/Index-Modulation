# Modulation Classifier

In order to test the robustness of the proposed modulation scheme, we use a deep learning technique, designed for noise channels, based on Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Modulation recognition model:

* **N-class decision problem**
* **Input is a sampled signal**
* **Output is a N binary vector**

## Dataset
* **Rician Fading Channel + AWGN**
* **Modulated Schemes**
  * **4-QAM**
  * **16-QAM**
  * **64-QAM**
* **SNR Range**
* * **5 db - 20 db**
