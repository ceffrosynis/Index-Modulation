## Modulation Classifier

In order to test the robustness of the proposed modulation scheme, we use a deep learning technique, designed for noise channels, based on Convolutional Neural Networks.

# Modulation recognition model:

* **N-class decision problem**
* **Input as a sampled signal**
* **Output is an N binary vector**
