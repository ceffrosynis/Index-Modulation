## Modulation Classifier

In order to test the robustness of the proposed modulation scheme, we use a deep learning technique, designed for noise channels, based on Convolutional Neural Networks.

* **Enhanced Spectral Efficiency**
* **Two disjoint available modes, the M-ary and the N-ary respectively**
