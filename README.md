## Index Modulation (IM)

Index modulation (IM) refers to a family of modulation techniques that rely on the activation states of some resources/building blocks for information embedding. The resources/building blocks can be either physical, e.g., antenna, subcarrier, time slot, and frequency carrier, or virtual, e.g., virtual parallel channels, signal constellation, space-time matrix, and antenna activation order. A distinct feature of IM is that part of the information is implicitly embedded into the transmitted signal.
