The Viterbi-like Algorithm can be visualized by means of a trellis diagram

In a trellis graph, each node corresponds to a distinct state at a given time, and each arrow represents a transition to some new state at the next instant of time. We divide the process into stages. Each stage has a k-combination set of the index pattern which have a size of k and there are n stages in total. For example, for an index  pattern with length 4, we have a trellis diagram with four stages.
